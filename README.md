# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn â€” identifying which customers are likely to leave the company.  
The goal is to analyze the data, compare models, and deploy a model for real-world predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The following models were compared on the test set:

| Model                | Accuracy | F1     | ROC-AUC |
|----------------------|----------|--------|---------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.740    | 0.613  | 0.836   |
| Random Forest        | 0.776    | 0.586  | 0.823   |
| XGBoost              | 0.773    | 0.570  | 0.812   |

- **Logistic Regression** was chosen as the final model due to its best performance on F1 and ROC-AUC, which are critical for churn prediction.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations (from the notebook)

- Feature distributions and correlations  
- Churn distribution by contract type  
- ROC curves for all models  
- Feature importance for Random Forest / XGBoost
